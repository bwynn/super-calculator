# Angular Calculator
This Angular Calculator application is a standalone angular application that running on Angular 1.5, with a Node and Express back end. There is no database attached to this application, as it is intended to be utilized on a case-by-case basis.

## Functionality
Early builds are intended to be fairly rudimentary, although plans to build out graphing functionality require a modular and scalable build.

## Responsive
A progressive layout design that is optimized for all viewports. The fluid design is flexbox based, and uses SASS for pre-compiled styles.

## Test Driven
All functions of this calculator are the result of test-driven development, using the Jasmine test module leveraging Karma.js for the Angular front end aspect of the build.
